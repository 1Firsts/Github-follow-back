# Github-follow-back
Github browser extension program code to follow each other when someone follows my github account

Replace **YOUR_ACCESS_TOKEN** in the code with your personal access token. Make sure the token has the **user:follow** scope.

You can generate a token in your GitHub account settings. 
Open Chrome browser and navigate to **chrome://extensions.** Enable the **"Developer mode"** toggle. Click on the **"Load unpacked"** button and select the directory where you saved your extension project. The extension should now be loaded and active on GitHub. When someone follows your GitHub account, the extension will automatically follow them back.

**Note:** This code is a basic example to demonstrate the concept. It doesn't handle rate limits or account for other potential edge cases. Make sure to thoroughly test and refine the code before deploying it for regular use.
